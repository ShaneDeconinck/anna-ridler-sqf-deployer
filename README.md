# Deployer

## Overview
This project is a web application for deploying the SFQ ERC1155 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The application is built using Vue.js and Ethers.js, and it interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask. Users can deploy the SFQ contract directly from the web interface.

## Components
1. **Vue.js Template:**
   - ASCII art logo displayed at the top.
   - A button for deploying the contract.
   - A terminal-like area for displaying deployment status and messages.

2. **Ethers.js Script:**
   - Connects to MetaMask and handles Ethereum blockchain interactions.
   - Deploys the SFQ contract and displays deployment status in the terminal area.

## Style
- The application uses a monospace font and a black background to mimic a terminal interface, enhancing the user experience for developers.

## Deployment and Usage
- Ensure MetaMask is installed and configured with the Ethereum mainnet.
- Open the application, and click 'Deploy Contract'.
- Follow MetaMask prompts to complete the deployment.

## Prerequisites
- MetaMask Extension installed in the browser.
- Vue.js and Ethers.js libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install required dependencies (Vue.js, Ethers.js).
3. Run the application locally or deploy it to a web server.
